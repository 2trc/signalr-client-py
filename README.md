# signalr-client-py

Python client proxy for [SignalR](http://signalr.net/).

## Requirements

Install the following prerequisites using `pip`:

* `gevent`
* `sseclient`
* `websocket-client`

The `gevent` package in turn requires Python headers.
In Debian based distributions (such as Ubuntu and Raspbian) they are called `python-dev`.

## Compatibility

Only compatible with Python 2, not Python 3.
